## Gameplay

ATHLOS is a 2D topdown adventure game, where the player controls Dimokritos. Dimokritos can use weapons to kill enemies and gather rewards. Dimokritos has three core abilities: ethos, pathos and logos. Ethos is his affinity to "order" or "chaos".
Throughout the game, Dimokritos will receive quests from gods and heroes, each of which has already sided with order or chaos. The quests come always in pairs, chaos or order. By completing one of the two, Dimokritos will gain favour with one of
two sides and contempt from the other. The balance of his ethos will determine special abilities for Dimokritos, as well as who will help him or put obstacles throughout his adventures. Pathos is Dimokritos's prowess. It determines how strong he
is in attacking or defending against enemies. The more enemies he slays, the stronger he becomes. Weapons and artifacts can improve his pathos too. Finally, logos is his intelligence, which he can use for good or for bad. He can use it to make wise
choices or trick those he can and those that he should not!

### Adventures and Quests

There are 6 main adventures and 6 quests. The adventures are given by pairs of gods, so every adventure has an order and a chaos outcomes. The two outcomes are mutually exclusive. The pairs of gods are the following (the "chaos" god is always 
mentioned first): Ares-Athena, Apollo-Hermes, Aphrodite-Hephaestus, Hera-Artemis, Poseidon-Demetra, Zeus-Hades. The quests are given by heroes. Although they do not play a role in the progression of the game and they can be ignored, they 
provide amazing rewards that can prove too useful to be ignored. Quests are given by the following heroes: Bellerophon, Jason, Heracles, Atalanta, Medea, and Ariadne. Heroes do not belong in a faction so side quests do not affect Dimokritos's ethos.

### Monsters

During adventures and quests, Dimokritos will encounter the following monsters: Chimera, Cerberus, Argos, Hydra, Medusa, Amphisbaena, Rhaecus the Centaur, Enceladus the Giant, Aello the Harpy and others. He may choose to kill them or capture them, 
depending on his ethos, pathos and logos. If a god asks for a monster to be killed, Dimokritos may capture it and attempt to trick the god through logos. 

### Equipment

Dimokritos can equip two things at a time, usually a primary weapon and an artifact with a special ability. Weapons include swords, bows or hammers, while artifacts can provide enhancements to ethos, pathos and logos along with special enhancements
such as poison, electricity, fire, speed and others.
